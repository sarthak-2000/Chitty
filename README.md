# Chitty (Web Speech AI Bot)

> This is a simple AI bot made with nodejs, web speech api and [dialogflow](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/#/getStarted)



This is how this web app works:

1. Using the Web Speech APIâ€™s SpeechRecognition interface to listen your voice from a microphone.
1. Send your message to dialogflow agent (the natural language processing platform) as a text string.
1. Once the AI from the agent returns the reply text back, use the SpeechSynthesis interface to give it a synthetic voice.
